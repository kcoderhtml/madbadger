# Usage

Customization can be done in `badges/badge.txt`

```
Counterspell
Kieran Klukas
@kcoderhtml
Hackclub
Organizer
he/him
@kcoderhtml
```

Feel free to add your github profile picture as an option too by running `profile-pic-downloader.py` and replacing my username with your username. 

Open thonny and select the `main.py` and badges directory and click upload to RPI and click yes to overwrite the main.py already there.

Using it is exactly the same as the [badger++](https://github.com/kcoderhtml/badger-2024/tree/main/examples/badge%2B%2B) version:

- A/B: Cycle back and forth through the font options.
- UP/DOWN: Cycle back and forth through the images in the `/badges/` directory.
